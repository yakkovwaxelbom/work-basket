# Sorting Algorithms Performance and Testing

This project demonstrates the performance and correctness of various sorting algorithms implemented in Python. It includes a set of test cases and performance measurements to evaluate the efficiency of the sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms Included
The following sorting algorithms are implemented in the `SortUtils` class:

1. **Counting Sort**
2. **Heap Sort**
3. **Bubble Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Radix Sort**
7. **Selection Sort**
8. **Insertion Sort**

## Project Structure

- `SortUtils`: A static utility class containing all the sorting algorithm implementations.
- `test_sorting_algorithm`: A function that tests each sorting algorithm using randomly generated arrays.
- `plot_sorting_performance`: A function that measures and plots the performance of each algorithm for different array sizes.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
2. Run the script to test all sorting algorithms and verify their correctness.
3. Execute the performance measurement to visualize the execution time for each algorithm.

## Example

To test the sorting algorithms and plot their performance, use the following command:

```bash
python sorting_performance.py
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- Tqdm
